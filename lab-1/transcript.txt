so I'm here to give you a math class on
making purpose crumbled eggs and I'd
like you and my wife to join in please
[Music]
so never ever seen eggs before we cook
them okay the eggs turn gray and watery
gas up three-quarters full okay your
eggs will be transformed after this
trust me
so we mix a couple of slices of butter
nice Jack and the song pick whatever
bakes can be transformed to something so
delicious a basic humble egg so clean
the pan as you go along plastic scraper
all the way around we're still not
seasoning by the way okay
and we never whisk your neck before goes
in the pan either see what I'm do now is
see how I'm clearing now you come off
the heat we come off then we continue
stirring you know why because they
continue to cook so butters Nelson
nicely and the seat behind any great
scrambled egg is to make sure we stop
the cooking so they don't become run
ready so now we get a nice and light and
fluffy okay now how good they look good
looking good this is where it takes on a
completely different level a little
spoon sour cream or creme fraiche just a
teaspoon salt pepper at the end CJ CJ CJ
CJ look look at that slowly now that's
where that's all gone
say the eggs will never be the same now
that's it
